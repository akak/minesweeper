Minesweeper Example.

When the board is more than 20 cells at any direction,
you will see a Layout map.
You can drag it, to see all the board.

TODO:
Scroll on dragging the board itself.
If we want to do it well, we shoul render a little bit more than the viewable board,
and then make smooth scroll...

There is some UX issues. We will do it another time.

Winning the game:
You win the game when you reveal all empty cells,
and not when you flag all mines.
It just makes more sense!

Tests:
Will come...
